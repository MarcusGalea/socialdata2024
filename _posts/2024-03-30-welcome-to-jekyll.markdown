We have analyzed the San Francisco Crime Data, provided by the police department of the city. More specifically we have looked into assault crimes due to its interesting sub crimes and the data it contained. We have explored the frequency, location and time of this category obtaining interesting insights.
In order to have a general understanding of the data we have plotted a multi panel showing its frequency throughout the day, its relation between months and weekdays, the most frequent sub crimes, and the relation between those sub crimes and the district they occur.

The plots show how there’s a higher frequency of crimes during the weekends and how it decreases during the early hours of the day, from 3 to 7 am approximately. 
The most dangerous districts from the data that we have are: 
- Southern, also known as South of Market or SoMa 
- Mission 
- Tenderloin

As can be seen in this article, those districts are still among the most dangerous ones in the city of San Francisco nowadays.

The following website shows that the crime areas have mostly stayed the same over the years. Four out of five of the most dangerous areas are the same. The website also provides a little description of the population of those areas. 
The Highest-Crime Areas Here are the neighborhoods that generate the most crime reports: 
- The Tenderloin District - this area has the highest violent crime and property crime. There's a concentration of seedy residence hotels and many low-income residents, along with a higher incidence of prostitution, drug dealing, and drug use. 
- South of Market - Not all the neighborhood is the same; the rough area is Market Street between 5th and 10th Streets. 
- The Mission District is a lively neighborhood that is primarily Hispanic. The crime rate used to be higher, and the area is currently "in transition." It has been attracting artists and writers. 
- Western Addition - the main attraction in this area is Japantown. 
- Bayview - low-income, residential, and industrial area.
